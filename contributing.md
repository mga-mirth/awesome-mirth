### Valid Sources

Roughly speaking, a source is considered valid if - it could be used by a development team or beginner today on a new Mirth project and not lead them astray.

An item is NOT valid if:

- it is an archived GitHub (or other) repository
- it is an outed project that is no longer actively maintained AND it's the type of project that requires maintenance. Eg: [minimist](https://github.com/substack/minimist) is an unmaintained project but it would still qualify as it doesn't particularly require maintenance.

An item can still be VALID if:

- it is a heavily used project/article (npm downloads being one metric)
- it is a heavily referenced project/article
